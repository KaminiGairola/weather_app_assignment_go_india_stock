# weather_app_assignment_go_india_stock

A new Flutter project which is an assignment named Weather Application given by Go India Stocks.

## Getting Started

This Flutter weather app allows users to search for and view up-to-date weather information for various cities. It displays temperature, humidity, airspeed, and weather descriptions with relevant icons. The app suggests random city names in the search hint and includes a refresh icon to update the weather data quickly. During data fetching, a loading screen ensures a smooth user experience. Utilizing the OpenWeatherMap API, the app presents accurate weather data in an attractive, user-friendly interface with gradient backgrounds and stylish containers.
